            <p>Hey there!</br></br> I'm Kai, The tech enthusiast behind Yumi. For the past five years, I've been immersed in AI work here in Japan, and it's where Yumi came to life. The idea was born out of real conversations from a mental health hotline, showing me the power of a listening ear.

I wear many hats â€“ coder, designer, and your go-to support. My aim? To make Yumi a helpful, easy-to-use app for anyone needing a bit of mental space. It's about straightforward, honest support, one tap at a time.</p></br>

            <p>Mental health faces a daunting predicament in Japan. With an estimated 30 million individuals suffering from mental health issues, a staggering 70% of them go 
                    untreated. Alarmingly, half of the junior-high and high school students experience mild to severe depression. In a society where mental illness is misconstrued as a sign 
                    of weakness or low will power, and where therapy is not covered under the national health insurance, the barriers to seeking help are monumental. This cultural perspective 
                    combined with practical concerns makes the need for accessible, relatable, and culturally-sensitive support paramount.</p></br>

                    and therapy's high costs make it inaccessible for many. Concerns about judgment from friends or the workplace often silence those in need. Existing online chatbots feel artificial and 
                    culturally disjointed, while helplines grapple with long wait times.</p></br>
